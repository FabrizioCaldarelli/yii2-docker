This is the repo of the official [Yii 2.0 Framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/) image on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/yiisoftware/yii2-php/) for PHP.

> ### Status
> This is still work in progress. The images available on docker hub are in **public preview** state.

## About

These Docker images are built on top of the official PHP Docker image, they contain additional PHP extensions required to run Yii 2.0 framework, but no code of the framework itself.
The `Dockerfile`(s) of this repository are designed to build from different PHP-versions by using *build arguments*.



## Setup

    cp .env-dist .env

Adjust the versions in `.env` if you want to build a specific version.

> **Note:** Please make sure to use a matching combination of `DOCKERFILE_FLAVOUR` and `PHP_BASE_IMAGE_VERSION`


## Configuration

- `PHP_ENABLE_XDEBUG` whether to load an enable Xdebug, defaults to `0` (false)
- `PHP_USER_ID` (Debian only) user ID, when running commands as webserver (`www-data`), see also [#15](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-docker/issues/15)
- `APACHE_ENABLE_REWRITE` whether to load or enable apache2 mod_rewrite, defaults to `1` (true)



## Building

    docker-compose build


## Testing

    docker-compose run --rm php php /tests/requirements.php


## MySQL and PhpMyAdmin support

If you want to add mysql and phpmyadmin support, copy .env-dist.mysql-and-phpmyadmin file instead .env-dist

    cp .env-dist.mysql-and-phpmyadmin .env

the rebuild:

    docker-compose build

You have other settings that can be changed:

- `MYSQL_HOST` host to connect to mysql server
- `MYSQL_DATABASE` name of a databased created at boot
- `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` password of root user
- `MYSQL_USER` username of user created at boot
- `MYSQL_PASSWORD` password of user created at boot    

To test MySQL and PhpMyAdmin support, start the services

    docker-compose up -d

To connect to PhpMyAdmin, go to http://localhost:8888 and type:

- `mysql` as server
- `root` as username (or dev)
- `root` as password (or dev)

These values can be changed inside `.env-dist.mysql-and-phpmyadmin` file.

To test mysql connection inside the php container, connect to it

    docker exec -it yii2apache_php_1 bash

(adjust yii2apache_php_1 with php container name if is different)

and then try to connect to mysql:

    mysql -h mysql -u root -proot

and you should enter inside mysql console.

Now you can connect to mysql also from Yii app.
